# PacMen_Exercise

**Title Description of Project**
Have you ever heard of PacMan? Well, he is back! This neat game allows you to bring him to your local browser. You'll be able to generate as many PacMen as your machine can handle and they will all bounce around with a life of their own. Enjoy!

**How To Run**
Create a Folder on your desktop. Name it Pacman Game.
Download all files into this folder on your desktop. 
Navigate to the folder, located on your desktop and open it.
Open the file named Index.html
  *This will open up your primary browser which will display two buttons: [Add PacMan] & [Start Game].
Click on [Add PacMan] to generate a PacMan image on your browser.
Once you have created a PacMan, click on the [Start Game] button to make the PacMan move.
Feel free to create as many Pacmen as you like by clicking the [Add PacMan] button. 
  *Because the [Start Game] button has already been clicked, the new Pacmen will automatically start moving upon creation.

**Roadmap of Future Improvements**
Allow the creation of different images
Create a button to control speed and reverse direction.
