# PacMen_Exercise

Create a Folder on your desktop. Name it Pacman Game.
Download all files into this folder on your desktop. 
Navigate to the folder, located on your desktop and open it.
Open the file named Index.html
  *This will open up your primary browser which will display two buttons: [Add PacMan] & [Start Game].
Click on [Add PacMan] to generate a PacMan image on your browser.
Once you have created a PacMan, click on the [Start Game] button to make the PacMan move.
Feel free to create as many Pacmen as you like by clicking the [Add PacMan] button. 
  *Because the [Start Game] button has already been clicked, the new Pacmen will automatically start moving upon creation.
